# MCP Integration

## *What MCP server was chosen?*
For this project, the GitHub MCP Server was used.  
GitHub MCP enables AI-assisted interaction with GitHub repositories, including commits, branches, pull requests, and merge operations. This allows common version-control workflows to be performed more efficiently with AI support.

## *How it was used?*
### Managing Commits and Branches
GitHub MCP was used to:
- Create and manage commits with clear messages
- Switch between branches during feature development and bug fixes
- Verify branch state before merging changes
- Reduce manual command-line operations  

This helped maintain a clean and understandable commit history.

### Pull Requests and Merging
GitHub MCP assisted with:
- Creating pull requests with meaningful descriptions
- Reviewing changes before merging
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Merging feature branches into the dev branch safely

AI support made it easier to track changes and avoid mistakes during merges.

## *How This Helped Development and Operations*
Using GitHub MCP improved both development and operational workflows:
- Faster Git operations: Reduced time spent on routine Git commands
- Lower risk of errors: Helped avoid accidental merges or incorrect branch usage
- Better focus: Developers can focus more on coding instead of Git mechanics
