# AI Workflow

## *Which AI was used and why?*
I primarily work with ChatGPT and Claude, so I used both tools for development.

## *What tasks were solved with the help of AI?*
AI was used to assist with creating UI components, implementing drag-and-drop functionality, defining API endpoints, and fixing bugs or improving the generated code.

*Examples:*
- Generating the initial project structure and core functionality
- Writing API endpoints for task CRUD operations
- Refactoring code to improve readability and structure
- Fixing TypeScript errors related to status types and route parameters


## *Examples of promts and responses*
- Initial prompt for ChatGPT  and Claude:
> Create task tracker with nextjs with the following functionality :
Each task has title, description and status (done, in progress, to do), the tasks can be added, edited and deleted.  The tasks are displayed in 3 columns based on the status. The status can be changed as well via dragging task to another column or by clicking a button. The interface should be styles with Tailwind and adaptive. The tasks need to be saved to a JSON file.

Response from ChatGPT (summary):
```
Overview
A simple Task Tracker built with Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS.

Features:
Tasks with title, description, status (todo | in-progress | done)
Add, edit, delete tasks
Displayed in 3 columns by status
Change status via buttons or drag & drop
Responsive (mobile-friendly)
Tasks persisted to a JSON file on the server

Tech Stack
Next.js 14 (App Router)
Tailwind CSS
Native HTML5 Drag & Drop
File-based persistence (tasks.json)

+ generated components, helper functions and API endpoints
```

- Update endpoints to validate incoming data:
> In POST request I need to check that the request contains all details (title, description and status), and in put request that if the task does not exist, it returns not found error

Response from ChatGPT (summary):
```
Good questions — this is exactly the right place to add server-side validation 👍
I’ll show you a clean, minimal, production-safe version that fits Next.js API routes.

1️⃣ Validate POST request body
Requirements
title: non-empty string
description: non-empty string
status: one of todo | in-progress | done

+ generated code

2️⃣PUT: return 404 if task does not exist
Requirements
id must exist
If not found → 404 Not Found
Still validate fields (recommended)

+ generated code
```

- Refactor UI structure:
> split the previous UI, so it is divied into TastBoard and TaskCard to make the code more readable

Response: 
```
Perfect! I've refactored the code into three separate components for better readability and maintainability:
Component Structure:

TaskCard - Handles individual task display
Shows task title, description
Edit and delete buttons
Drag functionality
Status change button

TaskBoard - Manages the three-column layout
Renders all three status columns
Handles drag-and-drop zones
Maps tasks to TaskCard components

TaskTracker - Main component
State management
API calls (load/save)
Modal for adding/editing tasks
Core business logic

This structure makes the code much more modular and easier to maintain. Each component has a clear, single responsibility!I have these data available already, use it on the page

+ generated code
```

## *What new aproaches or techniques did you find via AI? How it helped to facilitate development?*
Most API-related techniques were already familiar to me. However, drag-and-drop functionality was new.
The application currently uses native HTML5 drag and drop, but during development I learned about dnd-kit, and I plan to experiment with it in future projects.

## *Were there any difficulties and how you solved them?*

I identified both strengths and weaknesses in each AI tool:

### **Claude:**  
Pros:
- Better error handling for API routes
- More polished UI (Add task button, close button for modal)

Cons:
- Did not include PUT/DELETE endpoints
- Initially overwrote the task list instead of appending new tasks to the existing array


### **ChatGPT**  
Pros:
- Stronger Typescript typing
- Included PUT requests
- Created reusable helper functions

Cons:
- No Add task button initially
- Initially missed DELETE endpoint
- Lacked proper error handling for API endpoints
- generated PUT request for /task instead of /task/:id

### **Reflections:**  
The UI generated by Claude was visually better, so I used it as a starting point. However, I had to manually refactor the code to export shared constants and types to improve maintainability.
I  tested the API endpoints and added proper validation for POST and PUT requests. During this process, the build initially failed due to incorrect typing of route parameters in PUT and DELETE handlers. After correcting the parameter types, the application built and ran successfully.

Overall, using both ChatGPT and Claude allowed me to combine better UI generation with stronger typing and backend logic, resulting in a more complete and stable application.
